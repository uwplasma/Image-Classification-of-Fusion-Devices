# Stellarator Image Classification with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify stellarator fusion devices based on images. The goal is to identify key properties, such as periodicity, elongation, and device type (QA or QH), without requiring complex diagnostics or expert input.

## Key Features
- **Classify periodicity**: Identify the number of field periods from images.
- **Classify device type**: Categorize as QA or QH based on magnetic field contours.
